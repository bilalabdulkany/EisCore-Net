# Introduction

EIS Core library is developed to hide the complexities of asynchronous communication involved in microservices architecture
1.	Publisher component
2.	Consumer component
3.	Tracing and Auditing
4.	Active/Passive JMS Consumer implementation (Competing consumer problem solution)

# Getting Started

Given below are the list of steps to be followed to integrate EIS Core in Java applications

1.	Add the following library, versions will be communicated separately and same can be downloaded via NuGet package manager

		es-core-net.dll
		
	Nuget Package Manager
	
		//TODO Add command here
	
	
2.	Open your Startup.cs class and the below line of code in the ConfigureServices method:

		public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    	{          
        //Add the below code
        EisStartup.ConfigureServices(services);
    	}
    
3.	In the same Startup.cs class add the below line in the Configure method:

  		public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {   app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI(c => c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "event_publisher_net v1"));
            }

            app.UseRouting();
            app.UseAuthorization();
            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
            { endpoints.MapControllers();
            });
	    ## Add below code
            app.ApplicationServices.GetService<ConfigurationManager>();
            app.ApplicationServices.GetService<EventProcessor>();
        }
